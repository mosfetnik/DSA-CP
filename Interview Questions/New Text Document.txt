Interviewer asked me to implement MinHeap data structure from scratch including HeapifyUp/Down, Dequeue, Enqueue, Peek.
 Similar to "Top K Elements" (LC 347) but with different form - "Hire" (Interviewer had comments on indentation and readability)
Round 3: Crossword Puzzle (LC 2018), was not able to come up with optimal solution and not all edge cases were covered - "No Hire" (It led to my rejection)
Round 4: Priority Queue question (LC 347) - "Strongly Hire".
